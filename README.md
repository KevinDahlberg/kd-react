# KDReact

## Description

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and then quickly ejected.  Then, I added react-router and bootstrap 4.

This is a static site made for kevindahlberg.com.  It uses react as the front end, and Wordpress via the Wordpress REST Api for content management.  

### Frontend
Built with React, React Router, and Bootstrap.  The challenge for this site was bringing in the content/data and managing state without using Redux.  

### Backend
The backend portion of this site can be found at http://wordpress.kevindahlberg.com. 

* The supported theme: [wp-kdreact](https://github.com/KevinDahlberg/wp-kdreact)
* The plugin that makes some of the magic happen: [wp-rest-routes](https://github.com/KevinDahlberg/wp-rest-routes)
